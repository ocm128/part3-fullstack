You have to create a production version of the exercise of part 2 (phonebook) from its root directory with:

 `npm run build`

This BUILD directory will be the FRONTEND directory once copied to the root directory of part 3, which will be the backend of the application. 

In the package.json file of part 3 there are a series of scripts ("build:ui" and "deploy:full") where this operation is automated.
